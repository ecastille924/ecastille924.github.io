Hello World!

It's no surprise to anyone to say that the world we all live in has changed. I'm not talking about the slow, incremental change that we all experience throughout our lives, but a sudden, existential shift in the way we all are forced to interact with our own world. In short, my own ability to continue to survive and thrive in this new reality is the reason that I chose to study software engineering. 

Now for the longer version. 

I grew up in a few small towns in Texas and developed a serious love of music and art. I wanted first to be a visual artist, sketching characters and writing my own comic books. Then, I discovered that I was a pretty good singer and decided to pursue guitar, piano, drums and eventually music production. I had dreams of moving to New York and becoming a successful musician. I eventually married the love of my life who shared many of the same goals and desires, and we did, in fact move to NYC, and we started our own business and our own band, and for the first time in both of our lives, it felt like we were really living our dreams. Then, the world shut down. The bars where our band played could no longer host live music. Our own business was forced to close and we were forced to face an entirely new reality. 

Anyone who has a love for music or art knows that that flame never really burns out. It never really dies. But sometimes you have to find creative ways to keep those passions from sitting permanently on the back-burner. You have to find ways to utilize your own strengths as a creative person to fuel those passions. So, that's what I (we) have done. My wife decided to take her fitness business all online, and I decided to learn to code. Eventually, the skills I learn as a software engineering student could not only open the door to some very solid career prospects, but they could also allow me to help my wife grow her business, or our band to have a greater online presence. Life has handed out a large order of lemons to us all-- I chose to sip on some lemonade and learn to code.
